The ICSP (or "In-Circuit Serial Programming" header allows you to re-program the
PIC24FJ256GA110 without removing it from the circuit it's embedded in. The
pinout is as following:

                         1 2 3 4
                          5 6 7

  1 = MCLR - pin 13
  2 = VSS - pin 15
  3 = PGEC1/AN1/RP1/CN3/RB1 - pin 24 / ICSP Programming Clock
  4 = NC
  5 = VDD - pin 16
  6 = PGED1/AN0/RP0/CN2/RB0 - pin 25 / ICSP Programming Data
  7 = NC
  
  
  PICkit2:
  1 = VPP/MCLR
  2 = VDD
  3 = VSS
  4 = PGD
  5 = PGC

Note: On hardware version 4, pin 4 and 7 are unconnected. As there is UART
debugging functionality in the firmware it is very likely that on other hardware
versions these pins are UART connected.
